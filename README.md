# coronavirusSimulator
This is a simulation tool that models the effects of social distancing on the spread of a virus or disease like Coronavirus.

It takes a ton of stuff and simplifies it a lot and isn't a model for the spread of an actual virus, but it's still interesting to see how the numbers work out. 
Again, this isn't an actual tool that predicts anything about Coronavirus or any other disease.
